# Apache/PHP bootstrap for FAWS
###### Minimal readme to get started, re-working original MO lamp script for AWS

#### At this point only the directory structure has been re-worked for pure ansible rather than HEAT/ansible mix.  To-DO list for this project would include doing all of the below as well as writing new roles for Amazon Linux and other OS'es that may differ in supportibility from MO to FAWS.

1. Properly bootstrap an EC2 instance for apache/php
2. Include SSM
3. Include ScaleFT
4. Include sysstat
5. Include logrotate

#### Certainly not an all inclusive list, after a minimum viable product has been established, more will be added to the list as well as suggestions taken for expanding capabilities of this script.
